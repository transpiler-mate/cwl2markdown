# CWL 2 Markdown

CWL 2 Markdown is a Transpiler-Mate plugin that creates Markdown pages for CWL
workflows and includes project information from document-level Schema.org
metadata.

Use these docs by intent:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md): learn by completing a guided path.
- [How-to guides](how-to/index.md): solve specific tasks.
- [Reference](reference/index.md): look up commands, APIs, and configuration.
- [Explanation](explanation/index.md): understand design decisions and concepts.

## Quick start

```console
python -m pip install cwl2markdown transpiler-mate-runtime
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --output build/docs workflow.cwl
```

Start with the [guided tutorial](tutorials/first-steps.md) for a complete,
working CWL example.
