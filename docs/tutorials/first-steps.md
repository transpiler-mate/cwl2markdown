# Generate your first Markdown page

This tutorial generates Markdown documentation for a CWL workflow whose
document-level metadata describes a Schema.org `SoftwareApplication`.

## 1. Install the runtime and plugin

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install both packages:

```console
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install cwl2markdown transpiler-mate-runtime
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate the environment with
`.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead.

Confirm that the runtime discovered the plugin:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --help
```

## 2. Create a metadata-bearing CWL workflow

Save the following as `hello-workflow.cwl` (it is also available as a
[documentation example](../examples/hello-workflow.cwl)):

```yaml
cwlVersion: v1.2
class: Workflow
$namespaces:
  s: https://schema.org/
s:name: Hello workflow
s:description: Run a tool that prints a greeting.
s:dateCreated: "2026-08-26"
s:license:
  s:name: Apache License 2.0
  s:url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
  s:identifier: Apache-2.0
s:softwareVersion: 1.0.0
s:operatingSystem:
  - Linux
  - macOS
s:softwareRequirements:
  - https://www.commonwl.org/
  - https://www.python.org/
s:softwareHelp:
  s:name: Hello workflow documentation
  s:url: https://example.org/hello/help
s:publisher:
  s:name: Example organization
  s:email: info@example.org
s:author:
  s:givenName: Ada
  s:familyName: Lovelace
  s:email: ada@example.org
  s:identifier: https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000
  s:affiliation:
    s:name: Example organization
    s:identifier: https://example.org/
$graph:
  - id: hello-workflow
    class: Workflow
    label: Hello workflow
    doc: Pass a message to the hello command-line tool.
    inputs:
      message:
        type: string
        label: Message
        doc: Greeting text to print.
    outputs: []
    steps:
      hello:
        run: "#hello-tool"
        in:
          message: message
        out: []
  - id: hello-tool
    class: CommandLineTool
    baseCommand: echo
    inputs:
      message:
        type: string
        inputBinding:
          position: 1
    outputs: []
```

`$namespaces` defines the `s` prefix. The `s:*` properties are document-level
metadata around `$graph`; the runtime preserves and validates them as a
Schema.org `SoftwareApplication` before the plugin runs. The graph must contain
at least one `Workflow`, because standalone `CommandLineTool` processes are not
rendered as pages.

## 3. Generate the page

Run the plugin through Transpiler-Mate:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --output build/docs hello-workflow.cwl
```

The plugin creates the output directory and writes one page for every workflow
in the document. For this example, the result is:

```text
build/docs/hello-workflow.md
```

The page combines the Schema.org project information with the workflow inputs,
steps, outputs, and referenced command-line tools.

To render only one workflow from a graph, append its process ID to the source:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown \
  --output build/docs \
  'hello-workflow.cwl#hello-workflow'
```

## Next steps

- Review all [command options](../how-to/use-cli.md).
- Read how the [plugin processes a document](../explanation/architecture.md).
