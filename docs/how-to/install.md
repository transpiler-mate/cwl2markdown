# Install the plugin

## From PyPI

Install `cwl2markdown` and a compatible Transpiler-Mate runtime into the same
Python environment:

```console
python -m pip install cwl2markdown transpiler-mate-runtime
```

Verify that plugin discovery succeeded:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --help
```

The package registers a plugin entry point; it does not provide a standalone
`cwl2markdown` executable.

## From source

```console
git clone https://github.com/Transpiler-Mate/cwl2markdown
cd cwl2markdown
python -m pip install . transpiler-mate-runtime
```

Python 3.10 or newer is required.
