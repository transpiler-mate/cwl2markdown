# Use the command line

Invoke the installed plugin through the Transpiler-Mate runtime:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown [OPTIONS] SOURCE
```

For example:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --output build/docs workflow.cwl
```

`SOURCE` is a CWL location understood by the runtime. It may be a local path or
a supported URL. Append `#PROCESS_ID` to select one process from a CWL graph:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown \
  --output build/docs \
  'workflow.cwl#main'
```

The selected process must be a `Workflow`. Without a fragment, the plugin
creates one `<workflow-id>.md` file for every workflow and ignores other process
types. It creates `--output` when the directory does not exist.

## Plugin options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--output PATH` | No | `.` | Directory in which Markdown pages are created. |
| `--code-repository TEXT` | No | — | Repository URL accepted by the current options model. It does not currently change the rendered page. |

The runtime also exposes source-access options for OCI credentials and an
OAuth 2 bearer token. Run the installed command's help to see the complete
interface:

```console
transpiler-mate cwl2markdown --help
```

## Metadata requirements

The CWL document must contain Schema.org metadata at document level and define
its prefix in `$namespaces`:

```yaml
$namespaces:
  s: https://schema.org/
s:name: Example workflow
```

The runtime validates this metadata as a `SoftwareApplication`. The fields used
by the Markdown template are `name`, `description`, `dateCreated`, `license`,
`softwareVersion`, `softwareHelp`, `publisher`, `author`, `contributor`,
`operatingSystem`, and `softwareRequirements`. See the complete
[working example](../examples/hello-workflow.cwl).
